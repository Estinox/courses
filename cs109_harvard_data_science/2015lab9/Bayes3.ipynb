    "### The multiple risks\n",
    "\n",
    "We learned earlier that there are *two risks in learning* that we must consider, one to *estimate probabilities*, which we call **estimation risk**, and one to *make decisions*, which we call **decision risk**. We motivated these by the different processes needed to estimate probabilities and make decisions, but deferred a further discussion of them. Now's the time to have that discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we mean by a \"decision\" exactly? We'll use the letter $g$ here to indicate a decision, in both the regression and classification problems. In the classification problem, one example of a decision is the process used to choose the class of a sample, given the probability of being in that class. As another example, consider the cancer story from before. The decision may be: ought we biopsy, or ought we not biopsy. By minimizing the estimation risk, we obtain a probability that the patient has cancer. We must mix these probabilities with \"business knowledge\" or \"domain knowledge\" to make a decision. \n",
    "\n",
    "What we must additionally supply is the **decision loss** $l(y,g)$ or **utility** $u(l,g)$ (profit, or benefit) in making a decision $g$ when the predicted variable has value $y$. For example, we must provide all of the losses $l$(no-cancer, biopsy), $l$(cancer, biopsy), $l$(no-cancer, no-biopsy), and $l$(cancer, no-biopsy). One set of choices for these losses may be 20, 0, 0, 200 respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify matters though, lets presently insist that the **decision space** from which the decision $g$is chosen is the same as the space from which $y$ is chosen. In other words, the decision to be made is a classification. Then we can use these losses to penalize mis-classification asymmetrically if we desire. In the cancer example, we then set $l$(observed-no-cancer, predicted cancer) to be 20 and $l$(observed-cancer, predicted-no-cancer) to be 200. This is the situation we encountered before where we penalize the false negative(observed cancer not predicted to be cancer) much more than the false positive(observed non-cancer predicted to be cancer)."

    "###The regression case\n",
    "\n",
    "####The use of the posterior predictive\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly the risk we use in ERM. For regression we use $l(y_i, g(x_i)) = (y_i - g(x_i)^2$, where we interpret $g$ to be a **point-estimate** from a distribution of possible $y$'s at a given x. Where did this distribution arise from? In the Bayesian scenario this distribution arises naturally as the *posterior predictive*. In the frequentist scenario, we get them from different samples of our true population. Well, each set gives us a different $y$ and thus we get a distribution at a given x. Now, whow do we choose g? We can use decision loss $l(y,g) = (g-y)^2$ or even $l(y,g) = | g- y |$. The former one leads to the mean as the point estimate, the latter the median. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is why in beginning stats courses, the regression line is $E[y|x]$. It didnt have to be, but the choice of the squared loss makes it so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the idea we used in empirical risk minimization (ERM) is that validation or cross-validation risk is a proxy that estimates the risk on the population, the out-of-sample risk. But, notice from above that ERM minimizes decision risk, having **already estimated the probability distribution by the empirical probability distribution**. Thus, the model with the lowest cross-validation risk minimizes the population or out of sample error, leading to a model which generalizes well in the sense that the model that **will best minimize decision risk on future samples**. Or to put it another way, minimize the decision risk in your c-val process. Thats why standard `sklearn` uses accuracy, and cross-validation routines allow us to specify different scores, such as the F1-score, etc. And this is why you should be calculating ROC curves on the validation set, rather than the test set as we did on the homework. (The other reason for doing that is that it gives us an inference on the ROC curve, AUC, or associated metric)."

    "\n",
    "Typically, in a probabilistic classification model, say for example, when we do logistic regression with a log-loss, we have used this log-loss as an estimation loss to obtain the probability density $p(y|x)$. Two things now need to happen in the validation process: (a) we need to estimate the regularization parameter $C$, and (b) we need to make classification decisions using our decision risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "####Setting the hyperparameters\n",
    "But remember that we also set hyperparameters like $C$ based on our validation process. At first glance, this might seem wierd, since the regularization term is part of the estimation loss. But if you think about *choosing hyperparameters as choosing between different models, as opposed to choosing parameters of a model*, the wierdness goes away. What you do is you choose a value of $C$ on the grid, and *then train* the models other parameters using *estimation risk* on the training data. We then calculate the *decision risk* on the validation data. We compare all these decision risks and choose the $C$ with the lowest decision risk; that is, we choose the *model* with the smallest validation-set decision risk:\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that validation sets are typically smaller than training sets, since we are fitting less hyperparameters like $C$ in this model selection process on the validation set than model parameters like logistic regression coefficients on the training sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "####Validation is ERM on decision risk\n",
    "\n",
    "Something else might be bothering you now. When we trained our model on the training set for a given value of $C$, we did two things: we estimated the parameters of the model, and we estimated $p(y|x)$. Why not use this probability directly in the equation for overall risk to calculate it? Why are we doing the sum over validation points above? The answer is that we dont have an estimate of $p(x)$, which is needed in the calculation of the overall risk. So instead we must use an approximation to $p(x)$:\n",

    "$$p(x) = \\frac{1}{N_{validation}} \\sum_{i \\in \\dat_{validation}} \\delta(x - x_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which then gives us the equation we used above.\n",
    "\n",
    "####Recap of the process of learning\n",
    "\n",
    "With these loose ends tied up, lets recap what we did: we used the estimation loss (log-loss in Logistic Regression) to estimate the probabilities. Then we were faced with the problem of converting the probabilities into classification decisions. For this we used the decision loss on the validation data set, which might be identical to the estimation loss, a 1-0 loss in the symmetric case, or even an asymmetric loss like the one used above. The validation process provides a second service: model selection, helping us pick the best validation parameter. Furthermore, the validation risk is  an unbiased estimate of the out-of-sample risk, and by using the decision risk as the validation risk, we ensure that \"good generalization\" means choosing a model which makes the \"right\" decisions on future data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ERM only models like SVM (where we use a regularized hinge loss), there is no probability estimation. Typically we'lll use the same loss for parameter estimation (rather than likelihood or probability estimation) in the estimation phase on the training data, as we use in the decision phase on the validation data. Of-course if we directly want to make a decision like biopsy|no-biopsy or an asymmetric classification, we alter the decision risk to take care of this, having trained the parameters of our model (such as the SVM line/plane coefficients)."
